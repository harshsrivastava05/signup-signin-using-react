# signup-signin-using-react
i have created a signin signup page using react.js with backend.
signup take username, email, password and confirm password as insput to succesfully register a user/admin and if the user/admin alrready exists then it sends a json message as 
"user already exists" and if the password and the confirm password does not match then it sends a json message as " password does not match!".

signin takes username and password as input and check whether the user/admin exists or not.
if the user/admin already exists, the user or admin successfully logs in and if they are not registerd then it sends a json message saying " user does not exist".
